## Discussion

We need developer and help, for feature request and discussion, please go to our [Telegram Group](https://t.me/pb_go_discuss).

Bug report please attach log and finish the whole issue template. Thanks.

## Prerequisites

-   MongoDB
-   Reverse Proxy with HTTPS and Rate-Limit Support (Recommend: Traefik, Caddy)
-   A Linux Server (If you need Windows version, compile by yourself.)

Note: Since we are offering public services, we don't want to implement any rate-limit
on application side. You must apply a reverse proxy or something else do that.
You must ensure your proxy is properly configured to send `X-Real-IP` header.
Your data is encrypted and finally stored on our server using Chacha20 algorithm.

## To-Do list (features)

-   [ ] | Content detection, only allow pure texts.
-   [x] | Expiring feature done in MongoDB. Support Read-After-Burn.
-   [ ] | Private Share optionally, Sharing password using BLAKE2b stored. 
-   [x] | <del> Rate-limit to avoid abusing. (SHOULD BE DONE IN REVERSE PROXY SIDE) </del>
-   [x] | ReCaptcha v2 support to prevent from a large scale abusing.
-   [x] | Code Syntax Highlighting.
-   [ ] | Shortlink using hashids.
-   [ ] | Pure CLI. (You could also use `curl` instead)
